# Data mining (CS-E4600): graph partitioning

## About
Assignment for data mining course.

## Competition
We didn't take part in the competition

## Data

These graphs are not necessarily connected and they may contain a large number of connected components, which might result in trivial solutions (in particular, when the value of k is less than the number of connected components). Henceforth, if a graph is not connected, by convention,
we will work with its largest connected component.
